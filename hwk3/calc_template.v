/* Calculator performing the following operations on 4-bit inputs "data1_pi" and "data2_pi":
           op_pi = 0000:  Return 8-bit the concatenation of data1_pi  and data2_pi  (data1_pi is more  significant)
           op_pi = 0001:  Unsigned addition "data1_pi + data2_pi"  returning a 4-bit sum and a 1-bit unsigned overflow  (carry)
           op_pi = 0010:  Unsigned subtraction "data1_pi - data2_pi" returning 4-bit difference and 1-bit unsigned overflow (borrow)
           op_pi = 0100:  Unsigned multiplication "data1_pi * data2_pi"  returning 8-bit product
           op_pi = 1000:  Two's-complement addition "data1_pi + data2_pi" returning 4-bit sum and 1-bit signed overflow

For any other value of "op_pi", return "result_po" as  the 8 LSBs of  input "counter_pi" and "ovflw_po" as 0

   // Hint: Simplest is to use a case statement within an "always" block to select the Ëœoperation based on "op_pi"
   // You can also do it using only continuous assignment statements and the conditional operator.
   // You can use any Verilog arithmetic (+,-, *)  or logic (&, |, ^) operators directly.
